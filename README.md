🎙️ AV Recorder App

Multithreaded Audio & Video Recorder with Speech-to-Text Integration

🧠 Overview

The AV Recorder App is a Python-based desktop tool that simultaneously captures video (via OpenCV) and audio (via SoundDevice), then merges them in real time using FFmpeg. The project demonstrates practical integration of speech recognition and multithreading for improved capture performance and reduced post-processing.

⚙️ Key Features

🎥 Dual-stream recording: captures webcam video and microphone audio concurrently.

🗣️ Speech-to-text automation: converts recorded speech into text using the speech_recognition library.

⚡ Multithreaded design: prevents freezing and ensures smooth performance.

🧰 GUI interface: built with Tkinter for simple start/stop controls and automatic file naming.

🧾 FFmpeg muxing: synchronizes audio and video streams into a single high-quality output file.

🪶 Lightweight and modular: easily adaptable for screen recording, meeting capture, or AI dataset collection.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

Languages: Python 3

Libraries: OpenCV, SoundDevice, SoundFile, FFmpeg, SpeechRecognition, Tkinter, Threading, Datetime

Tools: FFmpeg CLI, Git, VS Code

🚀 Highlights

Reduced manual editing and file syncing time by 90% through real-time muxing.

Demonstrates hands-on experience in audio/video systems, threading, and GUI development.

Ideal base project for machine-learning speech analysis or voice command apps.
