# Senior-Project
The AV Recorder App is a Python-based desktop tool that simultaneously captures video (via OpenCV) and audio (via SoundDevice), then merges them in real time using FFmpeg. The project demonstrates practical integration of speech recognition and multithreading for improved capture performance and reduced post-processing.
